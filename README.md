# Switchboard Multi-Chat Service Client (pre-alpha) [irc, flowdock, slack, etc...]

Switchboard is built using a modular adapter system that allows you to integrate custom chat protocols with relative ease. Simply follow the 'Adapter Interface Requirements'. Switchboard andÂ the client will handle the rest.
