# Switchboard Multi-Service Chat Client (pre-alpha)

Switchboard is built using a modular adapter system that allows you to integrate custom chat protocols with relative ease. Simply follow the 'Adapter Interface Requirements'. Switchboard andÂ the client will handle the rest.


### Note

*Currently setup to run locally in the browser, or deploy to a server. The alpha version will include node-webkit version, which removes the express dependency, and adds native desktop support for mac/windows/linux.*


## Protocol adapter list

- ~~IRC (done)~~
- Flowdock (not-started)
- Slack (not-started)
- others... (not-started)


## Screenshot!!

Avatars are generated using a (soon to be released) new service built with [@bigtiger](https://github.com/bigtiger) and [@adorableio](https://github.com/adorableio)

## Getting started

```

Point your browsering devices to: `http://localhost:3002/`
